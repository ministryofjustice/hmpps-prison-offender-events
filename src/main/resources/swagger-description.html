<h3>Topic subscription</h3>
<p>Clients are expected to use a SQS AWS queue to receive events with queue subscribed to <b>prison-events-topic</b> or <b>hmpps-domain-topic</b> or both. </p>
<p>Clients can subscribe to one or more events. A typical subscription could be:</p>
<pre>
    resource "aws_sns_topic_subscription" "my_probation_subscription" {
    provider      = aws.london
    topic_arn     = module.hmpps-domain-events.topic_arn
    protocol      = "sqs"
    endpoint      = module.my_queue.sqs_arn
    filter_policy = "{\"eventType\":[ \"prison-offender-events.prisoner.released\", \"prison-offender-events.prisoner.receive\"] }"
    }
</pre>
<p>and this would be defined in the Cloud Platform hmpps-domain-events namespace or the offender-events namespace for <b>offender_events</b></p>
